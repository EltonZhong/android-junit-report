Android JUnit Report Example Project
====================================

Introduction
------------

This directory contains a sample project that illustrates how to use
Android JUnit Report with Ant.  The project itself is a default one
create by the android tool, with a simple test project under the tests/
subdirectory.

Files Of Interest
-----------------

The only source files of interest are:

  * tests/ant.properties: sets the test.runner property to use the
    custom runner.
  * tests/custom_rules.xml: defines targets that use the custom test
    runner.

Once you run some tests you will see reports in:

  * tests/bin/reports

Running
-------

To try out the sample, first build the main application, then run the
test-and-fetch target in the tests/subdirectory:

  $ ant debug install
  $ cd tests
  $ ant test-and-fetch

You should see the report at tests/bin/reports/junit-report.xml.  You
can also try a target with custom arguments:

  $ ant custom-location

which fetches a report to the same directory, but with the test suite
name included.  This latter example requires the device to have external
storage mounted.
